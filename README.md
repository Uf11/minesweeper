# Minesweeper Game

This is a simple implementation of the Minesweeper game in C++ using opp concepts. The game generates a board with hidden mines, and the player's goal is to uncover all cells without triggering any mines.


## How to Play

- The game board is displayed as a grid of cells.
- Each cell is represented by a symbol.
- To uncover a cell, enter its coordinates (row and column) when prompted.
- If you uncover a mine, the game ends.
- If you uncover a number, it indicates the number of mines in adjacent cells.
- Use the numbers to deduce the location of mines and safely uncover cells.
- To win the game, uncover all cells except the mines.
